## User Story

As an **AI engineer**, I want to **analyze question patterns from sample clusters** so that **I can understand how to structure AI-generated questions**.

---

## Description

Conduct detailed analysis of the 3 sample clusters to identify:
- Question structure patterns
- How 3D alignment is achieved
- Common question types
- Stimulus-to-question relationships
- Difficulty progression

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 3 clusters analyzed
- [ ] Question patterns documented
- [ ] 3D alignment strategies identified
- [ ] Question templates created
- [ ] Analysis report written
- [ ] Findings shared with team

---

## Analysis Areas

1. Question types (MC, constructed response, calculation)
2. SEP integration patterns
3. CCC integration patterns
4. DCI coverage methods
5. Stimulus utilization
6. Difficulty indicators

---

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: CC-007 (Sample clusters parsed)
