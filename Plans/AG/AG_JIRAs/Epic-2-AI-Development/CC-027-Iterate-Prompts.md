# Story: Iterate on prompts based on test results

**Story ID**: CC-027  
**Epic**: CC-EPIC-002  
**Story Type**: Task  
**Priority**: High  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Status**: To Do

## User Story

As an **AI engineer**, I want to **refine prompts based on testing feedback** so that **question quality improves to meet targets**.

---

## Description

Analyze results from CC-026, identify prompt weaknesses, and iteratively improve system prompts, few-shot examples, and validation prompts.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test results analyzed
- [ ] Failure patterns identified
- [ ] Prompts updated (2-3 iterations)
- [ ] Re-testing conducted
- [ ] Quality improvement measured
- [ ] Target metrics achieved (>80% 3D alignment)
- [ ] Final prompts documented
- [ ] Prompt versioning implemented

---

## Iteration Process

1. Analyze test failures
2. Identify prompt issues
3. Update prompts
4. Re-test with same stimuli
5. Measure improvement
6. Repeat until targets met

---

## Target Improvements

- 3D alignment: >80%
- Generation success: >95%
- Quality score: >3.5/5
- Stimulus utilization: >85%

---

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: CC-026 (Testing complete)
- **Blocks**: Epic 3 (Validation & QA)
