Please generate a Physics Cluster in Markdown format following the structure described above.

Your output should include:
1. A clear restatement of the stimulus
2. 1-3 questions, each with:
   - The specific Standard being tested (MUST use the Focus Standard for at least one question)
   - The dimension focus for each (SEP, CCC, DCI)
   - The question text
   - A detailed answer key with grading criteria

IMPORTANT: The cluster MUST focus primarily on {{ focus_standard }}, while incorporating the ancillary standards where relevant.
