## Questions

### Question 1
**Standard:** HS-PS-2-1 (Forces and Motion)
**Dimension 1 (SEP):** Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking
**Dimension 2 (CCC):** Cause and Effect
**Dimension 3 (DCI):** Newton's Laws of Motion

**Question:** Based on the scenario, calculate the net force acting on the object. Show your work and explain how this force relates to the object's motion.

**Answer Key:** 
- Students should identify all forces acting on the object
- Apply Newton's Second Law (F = ma)
- Show calculations with correct units
- Explain the relationship between net force and acceleration

### Question 2
**Standard:** HS-PS-3-1 (Energy)
**Dimension 1 (SEP):** Developing and Using Models

**Question:** Describe the energy transformations occurring in this system. Create a model showing how energy is conserved throughout the process.

**Answer Key:**
- Identify initial and final energy states
- Describe energy transformations (e.g., kinetic to thermal)
- Demonstrate understanding of energy conservation
- Model should show energy flow accurately

### Question 3
**Standard:** HS-PS-2-3 (Forces and Motion)
**Dimension 1 (SEP):** Engaging in Argument from Evidence
**Dimension 2 (CCC):** Systems and System Models
**Dimension 3 (DCI):** Interactions and Forces

**Question:** Using evidence from the scenario, explain how the forces involved demonstrate Newton's Third Law. Support your argument with specific examples.

**Answer Key:**
- Identify action-reaction force pairs
