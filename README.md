This repo contains information related to NY State Teaching Standards for Physics

- The Performance Level Descriptors folder contains NY State requirements (PLDs) that Physics teachers have to cover in the Regents Physics Course
  - The PLDS provide additional context and teaching requirements the NY State Regents Physics course
- The NYSSLS Physics Standards.pdf in the root of the folder contains detailed student expectations for Regents Physics
- The Physics Teaching Standards folder subfolders contains documents breaking out the student science and engineering practices describing how the students are to demonstrate their understanding of the learned performance expectations.
- Definition: Cluster
  Establishes a "story-line" composed of one or more real-world scenarios and related test questions which can be used in the Regents Exam.
  Each portion of the cluster consists of:
  - Stimulii - one or more sections called Stimulus, building on the storyline.
    - Each Stimuls typically consists of: a description, possibly a graph(s), table(s), diagram(s), and model(s) - A completed Stimuls section includes 1-5 questions related to the Sitmulus
  - A description of a real-world situation or scenario to which the students are expected to apply scientific reasoning from their Physics class.
  - Up to Six to Eight Questions related to the real-world scenario
  - Additional related scenarios maybe included in the Cluster to create a more detailed story-line.
  - The additional scenarios will be accompanied by additional questions.
  - Clusters focuses on one performance expectation as defined in the NYSSLS Physics Standard, while including other performance expectations related to the scenario
  - Clusters are designed to test students ability to apply science and engineering practices using cross-cutting concepts which are from other related scientific ideas.
  - Clusters utilize a 3-dimensional approach to test students ability to reason across three dimensions:
  - Dimension 1: Science Engineering Practices (What Students Do)
    - Asking questions
    - Developing models
    - Planning investigations
    - Analyzing Data
    - Using Mathematics
    - Engaging in arguments
    - Communicating Information
  - Dimension 2: Cross Cutting Concepts (How Students Think)
    - Cause and Effect
    - Structure and Function
    - Systems and System Models
    - Scale Proportion and Quantity
    - Stability and Change
    - Energy and Matter
    - Patterns
  - Dimension 3: Disciplinary Core Ideas (What Students Learn)
While each Cluster has a core teaching standard focus, a clust MUST test students abilities across dimensions
- The Sample Clusters folder contains:
   - sample-physics-clusters-2025.pdf
     - includes 3 Sample Clusters
   - Sample-physics-clusters-ratingsguide-2025.pdf
     - Answer key and grading guidance

Project Goals:
## When given the story-line component of a Stimulus and an array of Performance Expectation Standards such as: HS-PS-2-1, HS-PS-3-1, HS-PS-3-2 create 1-3 test questions where each question tests the students reasoning abilities in each of the 3 reasoning dimension requirements as defined in the Performance Expectation Standards.
