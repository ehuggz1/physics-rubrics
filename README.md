# Repo Contents

This repo contains information related to NY State Teaching Standards for the Physics Regents Exam

## Reference Documents

### Performance Level Descriptors

location: root/Performance Level Descriptors

The Performance Level Descriptors folder contains NY State requirements (PLDs) that Physics teachers have to cover in the Regents Physics Course

- The PLDS provide additional context and teaching requirements for the NY State Regents Physics course

### NY State Physics Standards

location: root/Physics Teaching Standards

The NYSSLS Physics Standards.pdf in the root of the folder contains detailed student expectations for Regents Physics

### Physics Teaching Standards

locations:

- root/Physics Teaching Standards/Energy
- root/Physics Teaching Standards/Forces and Motion
- root/Physics Teaching Standards/Space Systems
- root/Physics Teaching Standards/Structure and Properties matter
- root/Physics Teaching Standards/Waves and Information

The Physics Teaching Standards subfolders contain documents breaking out the student science and engineering practices. Each document describes how the students are to demonstrate their understanding of the learned performance expectations.

### Sample Clusters

- The Sample Clusters folder contains:
  - sample-physics-clusters-2025.pdf
    - includes 3 Sample Clusters
  - Sample-physics-clusters-ratingsguide-2025.pdf
    - Answer key and grading guidance

## Definitions

### Regents Exams

Regents Exams are standardized tests in New York State that assess high school students' knowledge in core subjects and are required for graduation.

### Storyline

Creates a real-world narrative description of an environment. A storyline consists of one or more stimulus creating a description of a real-world scenario the student is asked to explore using scientific reasoning

### Cluster
  
  A cluster is composed of a storyline and related test questions. A Regents Exam is composed of 6 to 8 Clusters.

  Each Cluster establishes a "story-line" composed of "stimulus" which are descriptions of real-world scenarios, and related test questions which are examples of questions which can be used in the Regents Exam.

- Clusters focus on one performance expectation as defined in the NYSSLS Physics Standard, while including other performance expectations related to the scenario
- Clusters are designed to test students ability to apply science and engineering practices using cross-cutting concepts which are from other related scientific ideas.


  Each portion of the cluster consists of:
  
### Stimulii

- One or more sections called Stimulus, incrementally building a storyline.
  - Each Stimulus typically consists of: a description, some or none of a picture, graph(s), table(s), diagram(s), model(s), and questions
  - A stimulus description depicts a real-world situation or scenario to which the students are expected to apply scientific reasoning from their Physics class.
  - A completed Stimulus section includes 1-5 questions related to the Sitmulus
  - Additional related scenarios may be included in the Cluster to create a more detailed story-line.
  - The additional scenarios will be accompanied by additional questions.

## Cluster Question Scope

### Dimensions

Clusters utilize a 3-dimensional approach to test students ability to reason across three different dimensions. While each Cluster has a core teaching standard focus and may require students to utilize tools from additional standards, a cluster MUST test students abilities across dimensions.

#### Dimension 1  

##### Science Engineering Practices (What Students Do)

    - Asking questions
    - Developing models
    - Planning investigations
    - Analyzing Data
    - Using Mathematics
    - Engaging in arguments
    - Communicating Information

#### Dimension 2  

##### Cross Cutting Concepts (How Students Think)

    - Cause and Effect
    - Structure and Function
    - Systems and System Models
    - Scale Proportion and Quantity
    - Stability and Change
    - Energy and Matter
    - Patterns
  
#### Dimension 3

##### Disciplinary Core Ideas (What Students Learn)

- Applying instructions and learning provided by classroom instruction, textbooks, and homework.

## Project Goals

When given the story-line component of a Stimulus and an array of Performance Expectation Standards such as: HS-PS-2-1, HS-PS-3-1, HS-PS-3-2  

- Create 1-3 test questions where each question tests the students reasoning abilities in each of the 3 reasoning dimension requirements as defined in the Performance Expectation Standards.
