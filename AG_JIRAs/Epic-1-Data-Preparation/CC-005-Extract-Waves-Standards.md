## User Story

As a **data engineer**, I want to **extract all 6 Waves and Information domain Performance Expectations** so that **the knowledge base contains complete wave physics standards data**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 6 Waves standards extracted (HS-PS4-1 through NY HS-PS4-6)
- [ ] JSON output validates against schema
- [ ] All required fields populated
- [ ] Manual validation confirms >99% accuracy
- [ ] Data stored in knowledge base

## Standards to Extract

- HS-PS4-1: Wave properties
- HS-PS4-2: Electromagnetic radiation
- HS-PS4-3: Wave interactions
- HS-PS4-4: Information transmission
- HS-PS4-5: Digital vs analog signals
- NY HS-PS4-6: NY-specific wave standard
