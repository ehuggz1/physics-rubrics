Bungee jumpers fall off the jumping platform, as shown in *Diagram 3*. The length of the unstretched bungee cord used at the Macau Tower is 50. meters.

#### Diagram 3: Bungee Jumper Falling Off the Jumping Platform

![Bungee Jumper Falling](diagram-3-falling.png)

**Image Description**: Photograph showing a bungee jumper in mid-fall after jumping from the platform, with the bungee cord visible trailing behind them as they descend toward the ground far below.

---

*Model 1* represents the relative amounts of mechanical energy that the jumper-bungee cord-Earth system has when the jumper is on the platform in *Diagram 2*.

#### Model 1: Relative Amounts of Mechanical Energies on Jumping Platform

![Energy Bar Chart - Platform](energy-model-1.png)

**Chart Description**: Bar chart showing three energy types:
- **PE_g_** (Gravitational Potential Energy): Full bar (100% of total mechanical energy)
- **PE_s_** (Spring/Elastic Potential Energy): Empty (0%)
- **KE** (Kinetic Energy): Empty (0%)

---

**Question 3**

Assuming no mechanical energy is lost, complete the model below to show the relative amounts of mechanical energies of the jumper-bungee cord-Earth system when the jumper has fallen 46.6 meters below the jumping platform. [1]

![Energy Bar Chart - After 46.6m Fall](energy-model-blank.png)

**Expected Answer**: Students should draw bars showing:
- **PE_g_**: Reduced (gravitational PE decreased due to loss in height)
- **PE_s_**: Empty (cord not yet stretched; unstretched length is 50m)
- **KE**: Increased (gravitational PE converted to kinetic energy)

The sum of all three energies should equal the original total mechanical energy from Model 1.

---

The 60.-kilogram bungee jumper falls 200. meters to their lowest point, coming momentarily to rest, as shown in *Diagram 4*.

#### Diagram 4: Bungee Jumper at Lowest Point

![Jumper at Lowest Point](diagram-4-lowest-point.png)

**Image Description**: Diagram showing the Macau Tower with the jumping platform at the top and the bungee jumper at the lowest point of their fall, 200 meters below the platform. The ground level is marked, showing approximately 33 meters clearance above ground. Note indicates "Bungee cord and jumper are not drawn to scale."

---

**Question 4**

Assuming no mechanical energy is removed from the jumper-bungee cord-Earth system during the fall, develop a mathematical model that could be used to represent the energy transformation starting at the jumping platform and ending at the lowest point. [1]

**Expected Answer Box** (for student work):

```
Students should write an energy conservation equation such as:

PE_g,initial = PE_g,final + PE_s,final

or

mgh_initial = mgh_final + (1/2)kx²

where:
- Initial state: jumper on platform (all gravitational PE)
- Final state: jumper at rest at lowest point (reduced gravitational PE + elastic PE in cord)
- x = stretch of bungee cord = 200m - 50m = 150m
```

---

The bungee jumper rebounded upward after momentarily coming to rest at the lowest point. The bungee jumper did not return to the height of the jumping platform after rebounding, as shown in *Diagram 5*.

#### Diagram 5: Bungee Jumper at Highest Point After Rebounding

![Jumper After Rebound](diagram-5-rebound.png)

**Image Description**: Diagram showing the Macau Tower with the bungee jumper suspended below the jumping platform after rebounding upward from the lowest point. The jumper has not reached the original platform height. Note indicates "Bungee cord and jumper are not drawn to scale."

---

**Question 5**

Considering the jumper-bungee cord-Earth system, which statement correctly describes why the jumper does *not* return to the initial height of the platform after rebounding?

1. Air resistance causes an increase in the mechanical energy of the system.
2. **Air resistance causes a decrease in the mechanical energy of the system.**
3. The gravitational force acting on the jumper causes a decrease in the mechanical energy of the system.
4. The gravitational force acting on the jumper causes an increase in the mechanical energy of the system.

## Automotive Optics Cluster

**2025 Sampler Automotive Optics Cluster-25**

Base your answers to questions 1 through 5 on the information below and on your knowledge of physics.

### Automotive Optics

A group of students investigated the various mirrors on a car. They performed investigations to determine how the shapes of these mirrors affected the reflection of light. The students used mirrors found in three different locations on a car, as shown in *Diagram 1*.

#### Diagram 1: Mirrors on a Car

![Car Mirrors](diagram-auto-1-mirrors.png)

**Image Description**: Photograph of an SUV showing three types of mirrors:
- **Rearview mirror**: Located inside the car at the top center of the windshield
- **Passenger side mirror**: Located on the passenger side door
- **Headlight mirror**: Located inside the front headlight assembly

The students discovered that a concave mirror is present in the headlight of the car, as shown in *Diagram 2*.

#### Diagram 2: Headlight

![Headlight with Concave Mirror](diagram-auto-2-headlight.png)

**Image Description**: Close-up photograph of a headlight assembly showing:
- **Concave mirror**: Reflective curved surface at the back of the headlight
- **Bulb**: Light source positioned in front of the concave mirror

---

### Questions

The students examined the functioning of the mirror and the bulb in *Diagram 2* and created the model in *Diagram 3*. The focal point of the mirror is labeled F and several light rays are shown.

#### Diagram 3: Model of Operating Headlight

![Headlight Ray Diagram](diagram-auto-3-ray-diagram.png)

**Diagram Description**: Ray diagram showing:
- A concave mirror on the right side
- Bulb positioned at focal point F on the left
- Light rays emanating from the bulb, reflecting off the concave mirror
- Reflected rays traveling parallel to the principal axis, directed toward the front of the car

---

**Question 1**

Four claims were developed when evaluating the operation of the headlight in *Diagram 3*. Which claim correctly identifies the purpose of the bulb and the mirror?

| Claim Number | Purpose of the Bulb | Purpose of the Mirror |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **(1)** | **Transform electrical energy to light energy** | **Redirect emitted light from the bulb to the front of the car** |
| (2) | Transform electrical energy to light energy | Increase the amount of light the bulb produces |
| (3) | Transform mechanical energy to light energy | Redirect emitted light from the bulb to the front of the car |
| (4) | Transform mechanical energy to light energy | Increase the amount of light the bulb produces |

---

The students observed that the rearview mirror in *Diagram 4* appears flat and functions as a plane mirror. To see an object, the mirror is angled so light is reflected into the driver's eye.

#### Diagram 4: Rearview Mirror

![Rearview Mirror](diagram-auto-4-rearview.png)

**Image Description**: Photograph of a rectangular rearview mirror mounted at the top center of a car's windshield.

---

**Question 2**

The diagram below represents the location of an image seen in a rearview mirror. On the diagram, use a protractor and straightedge to construct the path of the incident light ray that produces the reflected ray shown *and* identify the location of the object with an X. [1]

![Ray Diagram Exercise](diagram-auto-reflection-exercise.png)

**Diagram Description**: Shows:
- An observer (driver's eye) on the left
- A rearview mirror (vertical plane) in the center
- A reflected ray traveling from the mirror to the observer's eye
- The image location marked with "X" and labeled "Image" on the right side of the mirror

**Expected Answer**: Students should:
1. Draw the incident ray from the object location (behind the mirror, symmetric to the image) to the point where the reflected ray meets the mirror
2. Mark the object location with an X at the same distance behind the mirror as the image appears to be, on the principal axis
3. The angle of incidence should equal the angle of reflection

---

The group observed that the passenger side mirror contains the statement "OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR," as shown in *Diagram 5*.

This mirror produces an image that is upright and smaller than the object. The distance from the image to the mirror is less than the distance from the object to the mirror.

#### Diagram 5: Passenger Side Mirror

![Passenger Side Mirror Warning](diagram-auto-5-passenger-mirror.png)

**Image Description**: Photograph of a passenger side mirror reflecting a car behind on a highway. The warning text "OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR" is etched on the mirror surface.

---

Based on their observations, the group determined that the mirror is convex. *Diagram 6*, below, represents the size, location, and orientation of an object and its image formed by the convex mirror in *Diagram 5*. The locations of the focal point, F, and the center of the curvature, C, are indicated on the principal axis.

#### Diagram 6: Image of Object in a Convex Mirror

![Convex Mirror Ray Diagram](diagram-auto-6-convex-diagram.png)

**Diagram Description**: Grid-based diagram showing:
- **Convex mirror**: Curved reflective surface (curves outward) in the center
- **Object**: Upward arrow on the left side of the mirror
- **Image**: Smaller upward arrow between the mirror and the focal point F (upright, virtual, reduced)
- **Principal axis**: Horizontal line through the center of the mirror
- **F** (Focal point): Located behind the mirror on the principal axis
- **C** (Center of curvature): Located behind F, further from the mirror

---

**Question 3**

The students claimed that the same object, when closer to the mirror, will form an image that is larger and closer to the mirror than the original image.

On the diagram below, use a straightedge to:
- Draw a ray diagram to support the group's claims about the new image.
- Draw an arrow to identify the position, size, and orientation of the new image. [1]

![Convex Mirror Exercise](diagram-auto-convex-exercise.png)

**Expected Answer**: Students should:
1. Draw the object closer to the mirror than in Diagram 6
2. Construct two rays:
   - One parallel to the principal axis, reflecting as if coming from F
   - One directed toward C, reflecting back on itself
3. Draw the image where the reflected rays appear to diverge from (behind the mirror)
4. The new image should be:
   - Larger than the original image in Diagram 6
   - Closer to the mirror surface than the original image
   - Still smaller than the object
   - Upright and virtual

---

The students investigated the images formed by the convex mirror in *Diagram 5*. They measured the height of the image and calculated the image distance. Their results are shown in *Table 1*.

#### Table 1: Passenger Side Mirror Information

| Trial | Object Height (cm) | Object Distance (cm) | Image Height (cm) | Image Distance (cm) |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 16 | 240 | 2.5 | |
| 2 | 16 | 160 | 3.5 | -35 |

---

**Question 4**

Which row in the table below correctly shows the absolute value of the image distance and type of image for trial 1?

| Row | Image Distance (cm) | Image Type |
|-----|-------------------|-----------|
| (1) | 15 | virtual |
| (2) | 15 | real |
| **(3)** | **38** | **virtual** |
| (4) | 38 | real |

**Explanation**: Using the mirror/magnification equation:
- Magnification M = h_i/h_o = -d_i/d_o
- M = 2.5/16 = -d_i/240
- d_i = -(2.5 × 240)/16 = -37.5 cm ≈ -38 cm
- Negative distance indicates virtual image
- Convex mirrors always produce virtual images

---

On a different car, students noticed there was a small corner mirror inset in the passenger side mirror, as shown in *Diagram 7*. Manufacturers included the inset mirror to help reduce traffic accidents without changing the size of the mirror. The image of car A is circled in both mirrors. While there are benefits to including an inset mirror, there are also disadvantages.

#### Diagram 7: Passenger Side Mirror with Inset

![Mirror with Inset](diagram-auto-7-inset-mirror.png)

**Image Description**: Photograph showing a passenger side mirror with:
- **Main mirror**: Standard convex passenger side mirror with "OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR" warning
- **Inset mirror**: Smaller convex mirror in the upper corner with more pronounced curvature
- **Car A**: Vehicle visible in both mirrors (circled), appearing smaller in the inset mirror
- **Car B**: Another vehicle visible in the inset mirror's wider field of view

---

**Question 5**

Which statement best describes the trade-offs for including the inset mirror?

1. The image in the inset mirror is smaller and more difficult to see than in the main mirror, and car A appears further away in the inset mirror.
2. The image in the inset mirror is larger and easier to see than in the main mirror, and car A appears closer in the inset mirror.
3. **The image in the inset mirror is smaller and more difficult to see than in the main mirror, and more cars can be seen in the inset mirror.**
4. The image in the inset mirror is larger and easier to see than in the main mirror, and fewer cars can be seen in the inset mirror.

## World Record Jumps Cluster

**Sampler World Record Jumps Cluster-25**

Base your answers to questions 1 through 5 on the information below and on your knowledge of physics.

### World Record Jumps

Athletes competing in track and field competitions use speed as well as technique to excel in their specific events. In the long jump and the high jump, an athlete must propel themself into the air with as much speed as possible.

In the long jump, an athlete sprints along a runway and jumps as far as possible into a sandpit, as shown in *Diagram 1*. The long jump distance is measured as the horizontal distance from the takeoff board to the closest indentation in the sand.

#### Diagram 1: Long Jump

![Long Jump Diagram](diagram-jump-1-long-jump.png)

**Diagram Description**:
- **Top View**: Shows runway leading to takeoff board and sand pit
- **Side View**: Sequential photographs showing an athlete's progression through a long jump:
  - Running approach on the runway
  - Takeoff from the takeoff board
  - Flight through the air
  - Landing in the sand pit
  - Long jump distance marked as horizontal distance from takeoff board to landing point

Michael Powell set the world record for the long jump at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo. *Table 1* shows some information about Michael Powell's record-setting jump.

#### Table 1: Measurements from Michael Powell's Record Jump

| Measurement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Mass of Michael Powell | 79.4 kg |
| Time on runway | 6.36 s |
| Horizontal speed at end of runway | 11.8 m/s |
| Time in air | 0.7585 s |
| Initial vertical velocity component of jump | 3.7 m/s |
| Initial horizontal velocity component of jump | 11.8 m/s |

---

### Questions

**Question 1**

Use one or more mathematical relationships to support or refute the claim that the magnitude of the average net horizontal force causing Michael Powell to accelerate along the runway was 180. newtons.

Place a checkmark (✓) in the appropriate box to indicate if your analysis supports or refutes this claim. [1]

**Student Work Area** (for calculations):

```
Students should show work such as:

Given:
- m = 79.4 kg
- v_f = 11.8 m/s
- v_i = 0 m/s
- t = 6.36 s

Using F = ma and a = Δv/Δt:

a = (v_f - v_i)/t = (11.8 - 0)/6.36 = 1.855 m/s²

F = ma = 79.4 kg × 1.855 m/s² = 147.3 N

Since 147.3 N ≠ 180 N, the claim is REFUTED.
```

**Answer Boxes**:

- [ ] Support
- [✓] **Refute**

---

**Question 2**

Based on your analysis of the data in *Table 1*, what is Michael Powell's resulting world record long jump horizontal distance?

1. 4.48 m
2. 7.10 m
3. **8.95 m**
4. 15.6 m

**Calculation**:
```
Horizontal distance = horizontal velocity × time in air
d = v_x × t = 11.8 m/s × 0.7585 s = 8.95 m
```

---

In the high jump, an athlete runs toward a horizontal bar located a fixed height above the ground. Jumping head first with their back to the bar, the athlete attempts to clear the bar without knocking it off its supports. After the jump, they land on a mat, as shown in *Diagram 2*. In this event, the jumping distance is the vertical distance measured from the ground to the bar's fixed height.

#### Diagram 2: High Jump

![High Jump Diagram](diagram-jump-2-high-jump.png)

**Image Description**: Photograph showing multiple athletes in sequence performing a high jump using the Fosbury Flop technique:
- Running approach toward the bar
- Takeoff
- Arching backwards over the horizontal bar
- Landing on the mat
- Labels indicate the horizontal bar and landing mat

In July 2024, 55-kilogram Yaroslava Mahuchikh from Ukraine set the world record of 2.10 meters in the women's high jump at the Paris Diamond League.

---

**Question 3**

Which mathematical model includes data that can be used to calculate the initial vertical velocity needed for a 5.0-kilogram mass to travel from the ground to the same height as Yaroslava Mahuchikh in her record-setting high jump?

1. √[(2)(55)(2.10)]
2. **√[(2)(9.8)(2.10)]**
3. √[2(9.8)(5)]
4. √[(2)(55)(5)]

**Explanation**: Using the kinematic equation v² = 2gh, solving for v:
- v = √(2gh) = √[(2)(9.8 m/s²)(2.10 m)]
- The mass is not needed for this calculation
- Answer (2) is correct

---

*Graph 1* below models the relationship between height and time for Yaroslava Mahuchikh as she travels through the air.

#### Graph 1

![Height vs Time Graph](graph-jump-1.png)

**Graph Description**: Parabolic curve showing:
- **X-axis**: Time
- **Y-axis**: Height
- **Curve**: Begins at ground level, increases to maximum height (apex of parabola), then decreases back to ground level
- Shape indicates projectile motion under constant gravitational acceleration

---

**Question 4**

Based on your analysis of *Graph 1*, which claim correctly describes the forces acting on Yaroslava Mahuchikh and her resulting motion as she travels through the air?

| Claim | Forces | Motion |
|-------|--------|--------|
| (1) | Balanced | Her speed was constant during the jump. |
| (2) | Balanced | Her speed changed during the jump. |
| (3) | Unbalanced | Her speed was constant during the jump. |
| **(4)** | **Unbalanced** | **Her speed changed during the jump.** |

**Explanation**:
- Gravity is the only force acting on the jumper (neglecting air resistance)
- This creates unbalanced forces (net downward force)
- The parabolic path shows changing velocity (speed and direction both change)
- Answer (4) is correct

---

**Question 5**

Compared to landing on a hard platform at the same height, the mat in *Diagram 2* is designed to protect a high jumper during impact when they land. Place a check mark (✓) to indicate the magnitude of the force on the jumper and the time to bring the jumper to rest during impact with the mat, when compared to impact with a hard platform. [1]

#### Force

- [ ] Greater
- [✓] **Smaller**
- [ ] The same

#### Time

- [✓] **Greater**
- [ ] Smaller
- [ ] The same

**Explanation**:
- The impulse (FΔt = Δp) is the same in both cases
- The mat increases the collision time (Δt)
- Therefore, the force (F) must be smaller
- This protects the jumper by reducing the impact force
